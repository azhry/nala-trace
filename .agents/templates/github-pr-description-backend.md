# Backend PR description template

Use this template for Go service, GraphQL/API, authentication, persistence, or migration work. Replace every bracketed placeholder. Remove a conditional section only when it genuinely does not apply.

The PR description is the review and handoff record. Do not claim a check passed unless the exact command exited 0. Put blockers and pre-existing failures in their own section rather than presenting partial execution as success.

## Linked work

- Linear issue: [AZH-000 and URL]
- Parent/source issue: [issue ID and URL, or "None"]
- Depends on: [issue/PR and delivered artifact, or "None"]
- Unblocks: [issue IDs, or "None"]

## Summary

- [Observable backend outcome.]
- [API, security, persistence, or migration outcome.]
- [Important compatibility outcome.]

## Scope

### Included

- [Implemented behavior and affected package/path.]
- [Additional in-scope behavior.]

### Excluded

- [Nearby work intentionally not changed.]

## Verification

### Manual request/response sequence

[Fixture: real configured fixture or exact command that creates it.]

#### Step 0 — Authenticate and export the session token

```sh
[create script here to get the auth token with the account from `.agents/.env`]
```

Login response:

```json
{"authenticated":true,"token":"<redacted>","user":{"id":"<fixture-user-id>","tier":"<fixture-tier>"}}
```

#### Step 1 — [behavior under test]

Request:

```sh
curl \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "$API_BASE_URL/<path>"
```

Response:

```json
[copy-paste response]
```

## Known limitations and pre-existing failures

- [Exact command, exit status, affected path, and why it is unrelated; or "None known".]

## Reviewer focus

- [Highest-risk contract, migration, authorization, or concurrency decision.]
- [Specific file or behavior that merits close review.]

## Completion self-audit

- [ ] Every issue requirement is mapped to an implemented outcome or explicit blocker.
- [ ] Every changed operation lists its inputs, outputs, errors, and authorization behavior.
- [ ] Persistence claims cross a new request/client/process boundary rather than reuse an in-memory object.
- [ ] Migration up/down and existing-data behavior are documented and tested where applicable.
- [ ] Success, validation, unauthenticated, cross-user, absent-resource, and persistence-error paths are covered where applicable.
- [ ] Exact unfiltered commands and exit statuses are recorded.
- [ ] Generated coverage, logs, dumps, credentials, and unrelated files are absent from the diff.
- [ ] The linked Linear issue and dependencies reflect the actual handoff state.
